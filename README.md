Introduction into Python Programming

Welcome to this Introduction into Python Programming. This notebook was used as a live presentation during the CorrelAid Meetup 29.12. - 1.12.2019 hosted by CorrelAid (correlaid.org) in Berlin. Crafted and presented by Lisa G., Thomas H. and Max (https://github.com/MaxWhyte).

The data/csv file that we used can be found here: https://github.com/MaxWhyte/Correlaid---Projekt/raw/master/party_in_nyc.csv

The original data can be found here on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/somesnm/partynyc

Step-by-step tutorial on how to install Python/Anaconda can be found here: https://github.com/MaxWhyte/Correlaid---Projekt/blob/master/Intro%20to%20Python.pptx

Most solutions to the exercises are included just as we solved them during the class, some have been altered by Max for better understanding.

Have fun!
